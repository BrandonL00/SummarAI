## Inspiration
Sometimes, reading is hard! Have you ever read a passage in a book, just to realize you didn't actually read anything? Or have you ever stopped reading a book half way through, and a few months later you've forgotten what you read? Well we created the perfect solution for engaging reading that will help you remember details.

## What it does
Our application allows users to upload and store books, textbooks, magazines, or any other PDFs. The user can then use our interactive reader which provides tools to summarize previously read material, refresh you on characters from the book, and even provide flash cards!

## How we built it
We utilized MongoDB and AWS for file storage, React for the frontend, and Javascript, Node, and Express for the backend, and JWT and Bcrypt for user encryption. Most importantly, we utilized OpenAI's GPT 4 API for the heavy lifting of summarization

## Challenges we ran into
The major issues we ran into was integrating AWS and OpenAI's API. We also faced challenges with our repository and package managers, but we were eventually able to overcome them.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Using new tools and learning tons of new skills for the first time.

## What we learned
We learned the great challenge and immense reward when working as a team. Coding together is fun!

## What's next for Summarai
Polish and expansion on features. Reading is still hard and we can't stop until it gets easier.
